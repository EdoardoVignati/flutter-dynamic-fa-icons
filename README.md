# Dynamic FontAwesome icons in Flutter
Insert FontAwesome icons dynamically in Flutter app when the icons are not known at compile time.

The version of icons is:  ```5.15.3```



## USAGE

Just copy the class in your app and use the ```getIconFromName``` static method.

The name of the icons should be in the same format that you can find on [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/) (e.g. ```pizza-slice```)



Enjoy
